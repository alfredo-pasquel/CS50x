# CS50x
Problem Sets for CS50x
My Scratch project is a "chase" game. You have to evade the random trajectory projectiles. You start as a butterfly but when you get hit by the projectile you loose a life and turn into a bat. After getting hit a second time the game ends and "The End" background comes up.
You move your character using the arrow keys while "The Final Countdown" plays in the background to provide an extra epic soundtrack!
